Where I keep the Direwolf20 mod edit

V1 install instructions: Go to the FTB Direwolf Folder, then click on the Minecraft Folder. From that folder, delete the "mods" folder. Then, Unzip the "mods.zip" file.

V2 plans: Plain mods by themselves, for easy updates of induvidual mods.

Future plans: Move over to the regular minecraft launcher, when mods come inline with it.
