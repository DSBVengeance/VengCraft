Where I keep the Direwolf20 mod edit

V1 install instructions: Go to the FTB Direwolf Folder, then click on the Minecraft Folder. From that folder, delete the "mods" folder. Then, Unzip the "mods.zip" file.

V2 install instructions: Go to the FTB Direwolf Folder, then click on the Minecraft Folder. From that folder, delete the files in the "mods" folder. Then, paste the files from the downloaded folder into the "mods" folder.

V3 install instructions: Follow instructions from V2.

Future plans: Move over to the regular minecraft launcher, when mods come inline with it.
